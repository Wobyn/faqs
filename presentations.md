## Bots - the next UI revolution

Bots are the new UI frontier. Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa started the trend, but no-UI is the future of UI. Users are going to expect to be able to have conversations with companies and organisations in the client that they have on hand. Don't believe me? Gartner predicts that by 2020 30% of HTTP requests will be via bots.

In this session, we will explore how the Microsoft Bot Framework makes it easy to build and connect intelligent bots to interact with users and services. Take your existing applications, your FAQ or a great new idea you have and build a bot that will run from your website or from Cortana, Skype, a phone call, text message, Teams, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Skype for Business and more.

If you missed the mobile revolution - why not lead in the bot wars?


## Understanding Azure
Get an overview of the pieces you are most likely to need to build enterprise web applications so that you get an idea of what you need to know to be able to build Azure applications.
- Azure in 20 minutes - the Big Picture
- Machines in the cloud: 
Virtual Machines, VM Scale Sets, Managed Disks and Azure Container Services

- Serverless - Azure Functions and Logic Apps
- Azure Machine Learning & Cognitive Services
- Azure Bot Service
- Data and Storage: SQL Database, DocumentDB and Azure Storage, SQL Data Warehouse, Data Factory
- Azure Automation 
- Azure Resource Manager
- API Management and App Gateway
- Azure Service Bus
- Azure Traffic Manager and DNS

## Azure Service Bus Fundamentals
The Azure Service Bus is a highly-reliable cloud messaging service between applications and services, even when one or more is offline. When building distributed applications the service bus makes it easy for each of your components to communicate.
In this session we will look at how to build an application composed of several small services and to communicate between those services.
- An overview of the Azure Service Bus
- Queues, Topics and Relays and when each makes sense
- Why use a Service Bus
- Message based architectures

## Serverless and a better life without servers
Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. Azure Functions lets you develop serverless applications on Microsoft Azure.

Build an Azure based application from scratch using Azure Websites, SQL Azure, Redis Cache, Azure Service Bus and Azure Functions

## Building a cloud-based microservices API with Docker, Kubernetes and Azure Container Services
Docker has become the de-facto standard for containerisation and microservices. 
In this session we will walk though how we build scalable, maintainable enterprise applications using Docker, Kubernetes and Azure Container Services.
- What is Docker
- Kubernetes 101
- Azure Container Services
