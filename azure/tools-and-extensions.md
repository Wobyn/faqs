## How can I hide sensitive info on my screen ? 

Check out [Azure Mask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/azure-mask/amobeamdmdnloajcaiomgegpakjdiacm/related)

It conceals any sensitive info from the Azure portal and is made by the Microsoft Cloud Developer Advocates team. 

Great for demos and recordings !
